# ModularBookmarkPage
> made by Donovan Adrian in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS


## ***Task List***
- [ ] Create HTML Pages
- [ ] Create CSS Files
- [ ] Create JS Files


## Welcome!
This is a simple webpage that stores and organizes all your bookmarks,
preferrably hosted locally. Over the course of this project I plan to
allow for "drag and drop" organizing, and various other lists based off
of the initial design (to do lists, instructions, etc). Here's hoping
that all goes according to plan!


## How Well Does This Work?
I'm not sure yet! I'll be sure to update this when there is more 
progress made on the project.
